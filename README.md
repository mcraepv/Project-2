# Salud! [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Salud! was a labor of love for its creators. In the week and a half we had to
build Salud!, we learned and implemented both Angular and JSON Web Tokens. We
built our database from scratch using MySQL and Sequelize, and used ngBootstrap
for front-end styling. The idea grew from a desire to have a lightweight,
unintrusive way to find and save our favorite cocktail recipes. We hope this app
makes the good times better for anyone who uses it!
